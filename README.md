# Google Meet Interface Simulation

## Description
This project is a React application that simulates a simple Google Meet interface. It consists of two main components: `CardContainer` and `UserCard`. The `CardContainer` component acts as the main container for displaying multiple `UserCard` components, representing different users in the meeting.
